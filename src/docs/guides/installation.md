# Installation

The best way to start using Inferno is by [Create Inferno App](https://github.com/infernojs/create-inferno-app). You can get setup and running within a few minutes.

Alternatively, you can get started with Inferno using the [Inferno Boilerplate](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno-boilerplate) for a very simple setup.
For a more advanced example demonstrating how Inferno might be used, we recommend trying
out the [Inferno Starter Project](https://github.com/nightwolfz/inferno-starter) by [nightwolfz](https://github.com/nightwolfz/).

Our recommended approach to installing and using Inferno is via NPM. Alternatively, you can insert Inferno into your site via `<script>` resources
[directly from the CDN](using-cdn).

## Core packages:

The core Inferno package contains almost everything you need to get going and works out the box with JSX (note: JSX will need a build step).

```sh
npm install --save inferno
```

### Support for ES2015 components:

The core Inferno package **supports** ES2015 class components natively since version 4 out of the box. If you are still running an older version you can use class components with the now deprecated `inferno-component` package. 

```sh
npm install --save inferno-component
```

### Compatibility with existing React apps

Inferno can support most React apps by using a compatibility layer that sits between React and Inferno. There is a cost in performance doing
this, but this can help improve the size and performance of existing React 15.x apps.

```sh
npm install --save-dev inferno-compat
```

Note: Make sure you read more about [`inferno-compat`](https://github.com/trueadm/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-compat) before using it.

### Routing support:

Inferno's router will provide basic routing support and is usable on both the server and client. For more information on how to use `inferno-router`, visit the project page.
Check out the [routing guide](routing) for more information on how this works.

```sh
npm install --save inferno-router
```

### Server-side rendering support:

Inferno is isomorphic, which means it can work on both the server (with Node JS) and the client. It can render your components on the server using the `inferno-server` package.
Check out the [server-side rendering guide](server-side-rendering) for more information on how this works.

```sh
npm install --save inferno-server
```

## Installing a virtual DOM package

Behind the scenes, Inferno uses a concept called virtual DOM to create views/components that make up your UI. If you want to understand more about what
virtual DOM is, check the [virtual DOM guide](todo).

There are many different ways you can create virtual DOM with Inferno.

### JSX:

This package requires Babel 6+ and Node JS in order to compile JSX to JS.

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-inferno
```

### Hyperscript:

```sh
npm install --save inferno-hyperscript
```

### createElement:

```sh
npm install --save inferno-create-element
```
